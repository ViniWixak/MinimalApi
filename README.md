## Description

The easiest way to create a .Net API, using "dotnet new web" template, HTTP Status Code, Entity Framework, SQLite and Migrations to generate data base.

---

## Layout

The application uses Swagger to documentate and tests the endpoints, and are able to acces in this link: localhost:5001/swagger/index.html.

---

## Requirements

For development, you will need .Net installed on your environement.
And please use the appropriate [Editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) plugin for your Editor (not mandatory).

### .Net

[.Net](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/) .NET (pronounced "dot net") is a software platform developed by Microsoft that allows the creation and execution of applications for Windows, Web, mobile, and other devices. 
.NET consists of a programming language, a compiler, and a runtime environment that enable developers to create applications with different programming languages, including C#, Visual Basic, F#, and others.

## Languages and tools

The following tools were used in building the project:

- [.Net](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/) Consists of a programming language, a compiler, and a runtime environment that enable developers to create applications
- [Entity Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/) simplifies data access in .NET applications by providing a high-level abstraction layer that allows developers to work with data as objects, rather than writing low-level SQL statements.
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)  provides a standardized and user-friendly way to design, document, and test APIs, which can save developers time and effort while improving the quality and usability of the API.
